# Frido's Adventure
This repository contains the game Frido's Adventure which was part of a project for the module Software Engineering of my bachelor at the Nuremberg Tech University Georg Simon Ohm. The game was created by a team of students including [@marco-reichart]( https://github.com/marco-reichart ) and more.
